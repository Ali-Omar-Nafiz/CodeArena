# 🧠 Online Judge Problem Solving

Welcome to my repository for solving problems from various Online Judge platforms. This is where I practice and improve my problem-solving, algorithm, and data structure skills.

## 🗂 Platforms Covered
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)
- [Other Platforms](#)

## 📁 Folder Structure

OJ_Solutions/

├── LeetCode/

├── Codeforces/

├── AtCoder/

├── HackerRank/

├── CodeChef/

└── Others/

Each folder contains:
- `README.md` (optional): Platform-specific notes or tips
- Problem files named consistently (e.g. `001_Two_Sum.py`)
- Grouped by difficulty or topic (optional)

## ✅ Problem Naming Convention

- `###_Title.py` — where `###` is the problem number (if applicable)
- Suffix by language if multi-language (e.g. `.cpp`, `.py`, `.java`)
- Include difficulty level or tags in comments at the top of each file

Example:
```python
# Problem: Two Sum
# Platform: LeetCode
# Difficulty: Easy
# Tags: HashMap, Array

🎯 Goals
Improve algorithmic thinking

Participate in contests regularly

Build a solid repository of solved problems and approaches

Track performance and revisit hard problems

📌 To-Do
 Add more tagged folders (e.g., DynamicProgramming/)

 Track contest performance

 Add solution explanations or blog links

 Create scripts for auto-syncing submissions (future idea)
